# CS 237 ~ Machine Organisation and Assembly Language Programming 
General concepts of machine and assembly language, data representation, looping and addressing
techniques, arrays, subroutines, macros. Extensive assembly language programming.
The follwing porgrams were written with Motorolla M68000 CPU and bsvc simulator. 

## Projects/Assignments

There are at least four programming assignments in assembler, examples of which follow:  
**[Program #1:](https://github.com/kalrapranav/CS-237-Machine-Organisation-and-Assembly-Language-Programming/tree/master/Program%201)** A simple assignment designed to familiarize students with the simulator used in the course.
The assignment typically uses all I/O macros to familiarize students with proper usage.

**[Program #2:](https://github.com/kalrapranav/CS-237-Machine-Organisation-and-Assembly-Language-Programming/tree/master/Program%202)**  An iterative algorithm is given. Emphasis on debugging techniques and proper assembly language
programming.

**[Program #3:](https://github.com/kalrapranav/CS-237-Machine-Organisation-and-Assembly-Language-Programming/tree/master/Program%203)** This is usually the major project for the semester. Much larger in scope than previous projects,
a complete application program is developed. The project requires extensive flow control/branching code. Typically,
a more complex algorithm is used. Past projects include finding primes with the Sieve of Eratosthenes method,
reducing fractions with Euclid's algorithm (GCD), and binary search on data in an external file.

**[Program #4:](https://github.com/kalrapranav/CS-237-Machine-Organisation-and-Assembly-Language-Programming/tree/master/Program%204)** This programming assignment emphasizes subroutines and their proper implementation. Students
will develop two to four subroutines in separate files in addition to a main or 'driver' program. One of the 
subroutines is always a recursive function.
